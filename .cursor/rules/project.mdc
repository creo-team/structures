# Structures Project

Shared TypeScript structures for **Creo** projects. Enums, interfaces, types. Zero runtime deps.

## Key Resources

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/misc.ts` | Env, Stage, HttpStatus, FileExtension, etc. |
| `src/aws.ts` | AwsRegion |
| `src/package-json.ts` | PackageJson types |

## Key Conventions

- **Verb-driven function names** — prefer `get`, `remove`, `create`, `list`, `put`, `update` over `fetch`, `delete`, `post`. Name functions for what they do, not the HTTP method
- **Types in dedicated files** — interfaces, enums, and types live in `types.ts`. Never scatter type definitions across implementation files
- **Defensive guards** — double-check assumptions with `if` checks and logging. Don't trust that data is what you expect — verify and log when it isn't
- **Generators when appropriate** — use generator functions for iteration, lazy evaluation, and streaming patterns where they simplify the code

## Documentation Standards

Markdown docs (README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) follow these tenets:

1. **Concise Over Comprehensive** — short, scannable sections. No walls of text. If it takes more than 30 seconds to find what you need, restructure
2. **Won't Go Stale** — link to code instead of duplicating it. Inline-link to files in the repo rather than pasting examples that drift
3. **Single Source of Truth** — every fact lives in one place. Don't repeat the same info across README, CLAUDE.md, and AGENTS.md — reference it
4. **Tenets Over Tutorials** — state principles, not step-by-step walkthroughs. Tenets are numbered with a bold name: `1. **Name** — description`
5. **Inline Links Liberally** — link to other docs, files, and sections. Make it easy to navigate without scrolling
6. **Quick Start First** — README opens with what it is (one line) and how to use it (install + run). Details come after

## Verification

`npm test && npm run build`
