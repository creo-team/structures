# Structures Project

Shared TypeScript structures for **Creo** projects. Enums, interfaces, types. Zero runtime deps.

## Key Resources

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/misc.ts` | Env, Stage, HttpStatus, FileExtension, etc. |
| `src/aws.ts` | AwsRegion |
| `src/package-json.ts` | PackageJson types |

## Key Conventions

- **Verb-driven function names** — prefer `get`, `remove`, `create`, `list`, `put`, `update` over `fetch`, `delete`, `post`. Name functions for what they do, not the HTTP method
- **Types in dedicated files** — interfaces, enums, and types live in `types.ts`. Never scatter type definitions across implementation files
- **Defensive guards** — double-check assumptions with `if` checks and logging. Don't trust that data is what you expect — verify and log when it isn't
- **Generators when appropriate** — use generator functions for iteration, lazy evaluation, and streaming patterns where they simplify the code

## Verification

`npm test && npm run build`
